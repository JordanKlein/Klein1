What I learned from the reading for HW1: (Chunks of this are copied and pasted into this file because I didn't know how to put it into my own words!)

Part 1: Section 1.2
1) The framebuffer is what is responsible for determining the detail in an image. Before this I didn't actually know what was responsible for doing this!

2) I also learned just how powerful the GPU is. The GPU is so advanced now a days that is at least as complex as the CPU itself and is essentially a mini supercomputer!

Part 2: Section 1.7
3) I learned that the display processor was primarily designed in order to relieve the general-purpose computer from the task of refreshing the display continuously!

4) The pipeline works as follows: vertices -> Vertex Processor -> Clipper and Primitive Assembler -> Rasterizer -> Fragment Processor -> Pixels

5) The job of the vertex processor is to carry out coordinate transformations. This also includes computing the color for each vertex and changing any other attributes of the vertex.

6) The job of the clipper and primitive assembly is to assemble sets of vertices into primitives. Examples include both line segments and polygons. This stage outputs a set of primitives whose projections can appear in the image.

7) The job of the rasterizer is to output a set of potential pixels that contains information about color and location for each primitive.

8) Lastly, the job of the fragment processor is to, using the output from the rasterizer, update the pixels in the framebuffer.
